# Pizza Delivery Application using MERN Stack

Welcome to the Pizza Delivery Application! üçï This project was developed as part of the Level 3 Task from AICTE OASIS INFOBYTE, showcasing proficiency in Web Development and Design.

## Project Overview

The Pizza Delivery Application is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It offers a seamless experience for users to register, log in, select pizzas, choose quantities, and securely pay through Razorpay. On the admin side, functionalities include adding new pizzas, deleting pizzas, deleting users, and updating delivery statuses.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can register and log in securely.
- **Pizza Selection:** Choose from a variety of pizzas with the option to specify quantity.
- **Razorpay Integration:** Secure and convenient payment processing.
- **Admin Panel:** Manage pizzas, users, and delivery statuses with ease.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
